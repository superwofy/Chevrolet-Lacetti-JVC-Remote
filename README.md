# LacettiJVCRemote
 

Converts the lacetti's resistive steering wheel buttons to the digital JVC commands on the single wire interface.
Circuit parts used:
CJMCU beetle 32U4
10K pull-down resistor on pin A0
EL817 optocoupler with 820ohm resistor on input
5V regulator LP2980 50ma!


Taped it all to an old intellimute board which already had a regulator for its PIC.
